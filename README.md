# Module 7 Assignment - Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Background
Pewlett Hackard has asked us to evaluate their current employee population and the potential impact of a so called "silver tsunami". The "silver tsunami" refers to the aging population of the workforce, specifically from the baby-boomer generation, and the disruption that could occur when this segment of the population begins to retire. More specifically, a large number of tenured employees retiring at once can cause a significant loss of intellectual capital. Pewlett Hackard would like to try and curb this loss of capital by establishing a mentorship program that would ask members of the "silver tsunami" (employees born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955) to pass along this intellectual capital to younger associates. In particular, Pewlett Hackard would like to look into the possibility of filling the mentorship program with associates born between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1965. Our analysis will look at the feasibility of this program in protecting against the "silver tsunami."

## Pewlett Hackard Employee Analysis
After reviewing the populations, we have determined the following regarding the mentorship population and Pewlett Hackard's ability to effectively manage the program:

1. There are significantly more employees in the "silver tsunami" population then the mentorship eligible population. This makes senses seeing as the mentorship eligible population only consists of one birth year, but it will be an issue if they expect to transition knowledge from 72,458 employees to 1,549.

2. If the plan is to transition by position type, it is good to see that the distribution of employees in the silver tsunami population is very similar to that of the mentorship eligible population. It would be concerning to see a disproportionate number of employees retiring from a specific position since it would put strain on Pewlett Hackard's ability to fill the role.  

3. While it may make sense to look at a population of a certain age for the mentorship eligible population, it may be best to look for a population based on position. If you are trying to accurately transfer knowledge and would like to keep the transfer internal, it may be best to look at populations one position below the "silver tsunami" population that you want to transfer from. For example, a senior engineer who may be retiring soon may want to

4. While we have reviewed a large swath of the retiring population, it may not be needed to create a mentor program for all levels and with all employees of the silver tsunami. To make the transition easier, Pewlett Hackard should focus on transitioning knowledge for more senior positions and employees with more tenure. This will point Pewlett Hackard toward the employees that are more important when it comes to intellectual knowledge.

## Conclusion
Our review of the data has led to several key conclusions about the populations and the Pewlett Hackard's plan to transition knowledge as employees from the "silver tsunami" begin to retire, but there are two questions that we need to answer before determining next steps in this project:

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
	- As the "silver tsunami" begins, Pewlett Hackard will need to fill the roles of 72,458 employees across 7 different job titles: engineer, assistant engineer, senior engineer, staff, senior staff, manager and technique leader. 

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
	- There are currently more than enough retirement-ready employees in each of the departments to train the mentorship eligible population. The concern is that there may not be enough mentorship eligible employees to participate and obtain the amount of institutional knowledge that needs to be transferred. 

Based on the responses to these questions, and our review of the data thus far, we believe that there are additional queries that could be performed in order to gain more insight into the transition. First, for each of the job titles currently held by members of the "silver tsunami" we need to pull the employees who are eligible to be promoted and replace them. Therefore, for a Senior Engineer who is going to retire, can we find all employees who are currently employed as an engineer? Next, we will want to split the "silver tsunami" population into smaller subsets based on the individuals age, tenure and how likely they are to retire in order to prioritize the employees and positions that need to be part of the mentorship program sooner rather than later. 

These queries should help Pewlett Hackard begin a more detailed and efficient mentorship program.
